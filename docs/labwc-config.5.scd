# NAME

labwc - Configuration

# CONFIGURATION

The configuration aims to be compatible with openbox specification, but there
are some differences which are pointed out throughout the man pages.

Adhering to XDG Base Directory Specification, configuration files will
be searched for in the following order:

- ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/labwc
- ${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS:-/etc/xdg}/labwc

Configuration must be wrapped in a <labwc_config> root-node.
